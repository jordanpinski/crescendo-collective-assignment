# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) & assumes there is a local API bootstrapped with [Crescendo Collective - Frontend Skill Test](https://bitbucket.org/crescendocollective/frontend-api-skills-test/src/master/) server running on port 3001.

## Instructions

In the project directory, run the following commands:

### `npm i`
### `npm start`

## Notes

- Because this project has been moved out of the frontend-api-skills-test directory I copied the recipe images into /public/img.
